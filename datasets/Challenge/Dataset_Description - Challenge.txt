DATASET NAME: First Constraint Modelling Challenge

AVAILABLE IN: https://ipg.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/challenge/ChallengeInstances2005.zip

DESCRIPTION:
This dataset contains 46 selected artificial MOSP instances from the original set of First Constraint Modeling Challenge for the MOSP. These instances were selected considering their dimensions and the absence of special structures that facilitate the solution.
 
FILE FORMAT:
- Each file represents a single instance.
- First line: number of patterns (m) and number of pieces (n)
- In the following lines, a binary matrix m x n is described.

HOW TO CITE:
