DATASET NAME: SCOOP

AVAILABLE IN: http://www.scoop-project.net/DOCUMENTI/File/scoop_large_instances_data_set.zip

DESCRIPTION:
The instances are collected by the industrial partners of SCOOP Project. This set, provided by the Sheet Cutting and Process Optimization for Furniture Industry (SCOOP) Consortium, contains 187 realworld MOSP instances from two European woodcutting companies. However, most of these instances are too small, implying trivial solutions. Therefore, 24 instances with significant dimensions, ranging from 10 pieces and patterns to 49 pieces and 134 patterns, were selected for the experiments.
 
FILE FORMAT:
- Each file represents a single instance.
- First line: number of patterns (m) and number of pieces (n)
- In the following lines, a binary matrix m x n is described.
